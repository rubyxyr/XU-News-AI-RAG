- I want to filter and sort news by date, source, and topic so that I can organize my research materials
- I want to access historical news data and trends so that I can perform longitudinal studies

### Scenario Descriptions

**Scenario 1: Daily News Monitoring**
A market analyst starts their day by logging into the system. The overnight scheduled crawlers have collected news from 50+ RSS feeds and websites. The system automatically categorizes and indexes the content. The analyst receives an email summary of the most relevant articles based on their preferences. They can then use semantic search to explore specific topics of interest.

**Scenario 2: Research Project Support**
A graduate student working on a thesis about renewable energy trends uses the system to build a comprehensive knowledge base. They upload academic papers, configure RSS feeds from industry publications, and use the semantic search to find connections between different topics. The clustering analysis helps them identify emerging themes in their research area.

**Scenario 3: Competitive Intelligence**
A business strategist needs to monitor mentions of competitors and industry developments. They set up automated crawlers to gather information from news sites and social media. When the knowledge base doesn't contain relevant information about a specific query, the system automatically searches online sources and provides additional context through the integrated LLM.
